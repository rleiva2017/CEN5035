The Java files need to be imported into any Java IDE. After the files are in the IDE, the libraries need to be imported in order to the controller and connection to database to work.
After the libraries are added to the build path, the game will run.
For the controller, the XInput library needs to be installed in order for the controller to work.
After installing the XInput library, download a xbox 360 controller emulator and configure the emulator to make sure the buttons are set to left and right on the dpad. 
There is a exe file that can run the game without installing all the libraries as all the libraries are in the exe file.
